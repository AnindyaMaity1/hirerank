# HireRank – AI Resume Ranker (SaaS Free Tier)

HireRank is an AI‑powered resume screening web app. Recruiters paste a job description, upload multiple resumes, and HireRank scores and ranks candidates using Google Gemini, surfacing strengths, gaps, and a clear recommendation per resume.

The app is built as a small SaaS product: users can analyze up to **10 resumes for free per browser**. After that, the analyze button is locked and a paywall / upgrade prompt is shown.
